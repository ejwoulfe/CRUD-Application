Src files are the source code, the stuff you want to upload to github. DON'T LOSE THESE!
The source files will be then transferred to the build files once the website is ready to be uploaded to the server. (Npm run-script build)



Src -> styles 
There are several directories:
Plugins - Any plugins you import into your project
Helpers - Sass functions, mixins, variables
Base - Base css, so for the HTML or body maybe. Not much going into here
Layout - CSS for the major layout pieces like navigation, footer, jumbotron
Modules - CSS for reusable modules, so components or classes. Stuff that can be remade or used on other pages.
Templates - 

Then in main.scss there are @import for the directories
